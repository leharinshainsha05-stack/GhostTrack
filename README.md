# GhostTrack 🚛
AI-powered blind spot detection for Indian trucks.

## Problem Statement
Indian trucks have large blind spots on both sides, causing accidents involving 
pedestrians, cyclists, and two-wheelers. GhostTrack uses AI and radar to detect 
vulnerable road users in these blind zones and alert the driver in real time.

## How It Works
1. **Cameras** mounted on left and right blind zones capture live video feed
2. **YOLOv8 model** processes each frame to detect persons, cyclists, 
   auto-rickshaws, and e-rickshaws
3. **mmWave Radar** measures the exact distance of detected objects
4. **ESP32** fuses radar and camera data and sends alerts via UART to Raspberry Pi 5
5. **Alert System** classifies threats as:
   - 🔴 CRITICAL — object very close, immediate danger
   - 🟡 AWARENESS — object detected, driver should be cautious
   - 🟢 SAFE — no threat detected
6. **Driver gets alerted** in real time to avoid accidents
